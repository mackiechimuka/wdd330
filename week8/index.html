          Transformation and Animation Notes
        </h2>
        <p>
            Transformation property lets you translate ,rotate,scale and skew any element
        </p>
        <p>
           Translation functions allow you to move elements left,right,up or down on the page and are similiar to the behavior of position :relative when declaring top and right moving elements up and down right along y axis and xaxis.
        </p>
        <p>
           
        </p>
        <p>
            Translation allows you to move elements without impacting the flow of the document
        </p>
        <p>
            The translate(x,y) function moves element x from the left and y from the top
        </p>
        <p>
            TranslateX() function is used when you only want to move vertically and translateY function is only used when you want to move horizontally
        </p>
        <p>
            Scale(x,y)funcution scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically and if 1 one value is provided it will be used for both values.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scale will grow or shrink your element maintaining the same aspect ration.
        </p>
        <p>
            ScaleX()will scale elements in the horizontal dimensions and ScaleY()will scale elements in the vertical dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value and the point of origin is its center by default.
        <p>
            Value of rotate function are offered in degrees ,grads,radians and turns
        </p>
        <p>Skew (x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axis and if the second parameter is omitted skill will only occur on the x-axis</p>
        <p>
            Skew has also skewX() and skewY() functions for axis specific.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Transform origin is used to control the origin from which transformations are applied
        </p>
        <p>Transition allows the values of CSS properties to change overtime, essentially providing simple animinations</p>
        <p>
            CSS transitions are declared along with regular styles on an element
        </p>
        <p>
            Transition-property define the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned with all properties being default
        </p>
        <p>
            Transition duration properts sets how long the transition will take to go from the default state to the transitioned state and units are in s &ms
        </p>
        <p>
            Transition-timing function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail
        </p>
        <p>
            Transation-delay prperty is used to delay the begining of transition and its units are s and ms
        </p>
