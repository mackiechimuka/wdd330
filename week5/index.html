        <h2>Test And Debugging Notes</h2>
        <p>
            System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.<br> Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.
        </p>
        <p>
            User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Programmer errors are our responsibility, so we must ensure they are minimized as much as possible and fixed promptly. We also should try to limit user errors by predicting any possible interactions that may throw an error, and ensure they are dealt with in a way that doesn’t negatively affect the user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. For example, trying to call a method that is nonexistent will result in a reference error that raises an exception
        </p>
        <p>
            Stack trace is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
            A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method that started the sequence. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning. This might sound good, but it can be problematic, since the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to continue running incorrectly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not using strict mode is often referred to as 'sloppy mode' as it’s forgiving of sloppy programming practices. Strict mode encourages a better quality of JavaScript to be written.
        </p>
        <p>
            'use strict'; is required to use strict mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you try to assign a value to a variable that is undeclared in strict mode, you'll get an exception, instead of a warning. </p>
        <p>
            You can even use strict mode on a per-function basis by adding the line inside a function. Strict mode will then only be applied to anything inside that function.
        </p>
        <p>The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. This is done using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to actually call the method.</p>
        <p>
            The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code. Because alert() stops a program from running until OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of variables at that point to see if they’re what we expect them to be.

        <p>We can now create an instance of the dice constructor function using the new operator.<code>const redDice = new Dice();
             Dice { sides: 6, roll: [Function] }</code></p>
            <p>
                console.log() can be used to log the value of variables at different stages of the program, although it will not actually stop the execution of the program in the same way as alert() does.
            </p>
        <p>
            he console.trace() method will log an interactive stack trace in the console. This will show the functions that were called in the lead up to an exception occurring while the code is running.
        </p>
        <p>
            An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function. An example is const error = new Error();
        </p>
        <p>
            EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function.
        </p>
        <p>
            RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.
        </p>
        <p>
            ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a function that hasn't been defined
        </p>
        <p>
            SyntaxError is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.
        </p>
        <p>
            TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expect
        </p>
        <p>
            URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URL
        </p>
        <p>
            InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much recursion.
        </p>
        <p>Try and catch error example
            <code>
                function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {
                    'use strict';
                    let answer;
                    try {
                        answer = String(squareRoot(number));
                    } catch(error) {
                        answer = squareRoot(-number)+"i";
                    } finally {
                        return `+ or - ${answer}`;
                    }
                }
            </code>
