        <h2>Form notes </h2>
        <p>
            document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup.<br> An example of using document.form isconst form = document.forms[0];
        </p>
        <p>
            We can use the name attribute to identify the form instead of using numeric index.
        </p>
        <p>A form object  has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection of all the elements contained in the form.<br>onst [input,button] = form.elements; is an example using the element method.</p>
        <p>
            We can also access the form controls using their 'name' attributes as if it was a property of the form object. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically and this method wont trigger theform submit.
        </p>
        <p>
            he form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
            The form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so it’s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server.
        </p>
        <p>
            The focus event occurs when an element is focused on. In the case of an <strong>input</strong> element, this is when the cursor is placed inside the element (either by clicking or tapping on it or navigating to it using the keyboard).
        </p>
        <p>
            The blur event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element.
        </p>
        <p>submit event,usually this will send the content of the form to the server to be processed, but we can use JavaScript to intercept the form before it’s sent by adding a submit event listener. </p>
        <p>
            Text input element objects have a value property that can be used to retrieve the text inside the field.
        </p>
        <h2>Object Oriented</h2>
        <p>We can create objects using the constructor method.</p>
        <p>
            Text input element objects have a value property that can be used to retrieve the text inside the field.
        </p>
        <p> Example of constructor method<code>const Dice = function(sides=6){
            this.sides = sides;
            this.roll = function() {
                return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
            }
        }</code></p>
        <p>We can now create an instance of the dice constructor function using the new operator.<code>const redDice = new Dice();
             Dice { sides: 6, roll: [Function] }</code></p>
             <p>Declaration using the class of objects <code>class Dice {
                constructor(sides=6) {
                    this.sides = sides;
                }
            
                roll() {
                    return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
                }
            }</code></p>
