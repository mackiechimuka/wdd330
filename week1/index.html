      <p>When I watched  Master Mobile UX I learned something that I never considered when I was building my websites to think small from mobile perspective. I used to think from large screen when I was designing my websites, I thought my website being responsive would solve the problem of that and I also notice that most users use mobile phones to access to the web which is one of the most essential reason to design from mobile perspective .</p>
