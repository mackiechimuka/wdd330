        <h2>Arrays,Logic And loops Notes </h2>
        <p>
            An Array is an odered list.<br> There are two ways of creating arrays and these two ways are array literals and array constructor function.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most prefered way to create arrays by most developers is using array literals.
        </p>
        <p>When we want to access an area we used the square barackets and put the position of an array know as an index. The Index of an area start from 0</p>
        <p>
            We can place or add values do the arrays by using index for example <code>let myArray = ["John"] ; myArray[0] = "Laura"</code>. As you can see we have added our array as the first value of the Array.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pop method remove the last item in an array. The push method add an item to the value.The shift method removes the first item in a list.The unshift method add the element on the first position.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can merge an array with a concat() method. The spread operator is three dots ()...) that are placed in front of an array, with the effect of spreading out the elements of that array.
        </p>
        <p>
            The join() method can be used to turn the array into a string that comprises all the items in the array, separated by commas.
        </p>
        <p>
            he slice() method creates a subarray; effectively chopping out a slice of an original array, starting at one position and finishing at another.
        </p>
        <p>
            The splice() method removes items from an array then inserts new items in their place.
